This project is a small Library Management System that I built using React. It’s basically a simple frontend that has a few pages, some basic navigation, and a clean layout to make everything easy to look at. I tried to keep things straightforward, so the structure is mostly just React components that handle different parts of the interface.

The styling is done with normal CSS, and React Router is used to switch between pages. Most of the work went into getting the pages to look organized and making sure the components were separated in a way that makes sense. It’s not a full system with a backend or anything like that, just a simple UI that shows how a library website might be set up.

Working on it helped me understand React better and how to break things down into smaller pieces. It’s a pretty simple project overall, but it covers the basics of components, routing, and layout.
